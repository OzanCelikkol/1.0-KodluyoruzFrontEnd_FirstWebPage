# Assignment 1

## Creating First Web Page

In this assignment we need to create 'our first web page'. Our request from you is creating a simple web page by using the elements you have learnt so far.

* As we open the page, we should see your full name as a header.(H1)
* There should be an another header as 'About' just under your full name.(H2)
* Under the 'About' section, one paragraph has to be placed. It can include anything like your interests and hobbies.
* You have to be sure that your file is saved as 'index.html'.
* Do not forget to add comments that explain your code.
